# Profiles
Profile functions and their analytical properties

This package implements some profile functions and their analytical properties.
Profile functions are considered to be scalar functions of one variable `x`, where `x`
can range from 0 to 1. They are typically monotonic with their maximum at `x=0`
and their minimum, which is typically 0, at `x=1`.
